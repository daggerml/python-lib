## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: `Dml` stores only runtime context and temporary-directory bookkeeping
The shared `Dml` class SHALL keep only `_context` and `_tempdirs` as private instance attributes. Helper behavior that supports `Dml` public methods SHALL live in module-level functions within `daggerml._internal.dml` rather than in private `Dml` instance methods.

#### Scenario: Namespace and helper access do not require extra Dml instance fields
- **WHEN** a caller uses any public namespace on `Dml`
- **THEN** the namespace behavior is derived from `_context`, `_tempdirs`, and delegated helper logic without introducing additional private `Dml` instance attributes

#### Scenario: Dml public workflows do not depend on private helper methods
- **WHEN** a `Dml` repository, runtime, DAG, admin, or config workflow needs helper behavior such as ops dispatch, payload shaping, or revision binding
- **THEN** that helper behavior executes through module-level functions in `daggerml._internal.dml` rather than through `Dml._...` instance methods

#### Scenario: Namespace objects keep only Dml as private state
- **WHEN** a caller inspects the namespace objects exposed by `Dml`
- **THEN** each namespace object keeps only `._dml` as private instance state
- **AND** namespace helper behavior does not rely on additional private attrs or private helper methods on the namespace object
